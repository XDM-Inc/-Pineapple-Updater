# -Pineapple-Updater
A small, rudimentary script to update yuzu-EA (Linux) based on Pineapple-EA
simply mark as exeacutable and click on it or click run in terminal
it will download the latest EA appimage version of yuzu courtesy [pineapple-src](https://github.com/pineappleEA/pineapple-src)  

future plans for this
- make GUI version
- make it detect if you are already on the latest version.
- allow for keeping 1-3 old versions for backup/rollback purposes
